# EduLearn App - Issues Fixed

## üîß Issues Resolved

### 1. **Lines appearing when opening the app** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: Debug lines/overlay appearing in the app
**Solution**: The `debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false` was already set in main.dart, which removes the debug banner. If you're still seeing lines, they might be from:
- Flutter Inspector (disable in IDE)
- Device developer options (disable "Show layout bounds")

### 2. **Assignment submission feature not working** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: The "Submit Assignment" button didn't actually handle submissions
**Solution**: 
- Added `_showSubmissionDialog()` method with full submission functionality
- Fixed both the detail modal button and quick action button to use the new dialog
- Added proper validation, loading states, and success/error feedback
- Submissions now properly save to Firestore and update assignment status

**New Features Added**:
- Rich submission dialog with assignment details
- Multi-line text input for submissions
- Real-time validation
- Loading indicators during submission
- Success/error notifications
- Automatic assignment list refresh after submission

### 3. **Biometric authentication location** ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
**Problem**: Biometric service existed but wasn't integrated into login
**Solution**: 
- Added biometric authentication to login screen
- Added biometric availability detection
- Added toggle to enable/disable biometric login
- Added fingerprint login button with proper error handling

**New Features Added**:
- Biometric login button on login screen
- Enable/disable biometric toggle
- Automatic biometric availability detection
- Proper error handling and user feedback
- Visual separation between regular and biometric login

## üì± Where Biometric Authentication Works

Biometric authentication is now available in:
1. **Login Screen** - Main biometric login button
